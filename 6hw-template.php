        <p>From the 1st June – 6th July, Valley Church is privileged to host six outstanding preachers and teachers from around the world. Each will speak relevantly into your life from their wealth of experience to equip, empower and inspire you. There’s something for everyone at Six Hot Weekends so we don’t want you to miss any of it; a full children’s programme for 1-11s runs alongside each service, whilst a parent and baby facility is available for those with 0-1s. The evening includes our popular youth programme for 11-14s. Join us afterwards at Valley Cafe for a filter coffee or tea and a freshly baked sweet treat.</p>
        <p>Everyone is welcome!</p>

        <p>Pastors Gary and Heather Snowzell have been leading and pioneering church for over 25 years in and around Herefordshire. This influence is now spilling out of the county into the nations. Their marriage is an example to any and all their five sons an incredible testament to them as parents.</p>

        <p>In 2004 God gave Pastor Gary a vision for something more than they had built up until that point and at its core was a desire to be a movement of campuses with scope to expand beyond some of the limitations they were facing with their current model and location.</p>

        <p>In 2005 evening meetings began in a local pub in Hereford city. This was the birth of Freedom Church. Their first campuses outside the county of Herefordshire were launched in March 2011, Freedom Cardiff began and in August Freedom Kampala, in Uganda. Both saw small teams of radical believers going to plant relevant, wildfire filled churches in places marked by religion and tradition.</p>

        <p>The adventure continued in 2012 with the launch of their first Freedom campus on mainland Europe, in Brugge, Belgium. These three campuses have already developed strongly; have home grown leadership structures, large central Sunday events and genuinely vibrant, small group life.</p>

        <p>They currently have extensions in Swansea, Bristol, Odessa, Singapore and Fiji.</p>

        <p>In 2013 the first campus was launched in Asia. Freedom Church Siem Reap, Cambodia kicked off with over 700 people at the first event, and more than 100 commitments to follow Christ!</p>

        <p>Pastor Gary loves fast cars and any challenge you could throw down. Heather laughs, loves and her creative heart has shaped so much of what Freedom Church does.</p>
